This is a Mario styled blog web app that highlights my learning journey of integrating React and Redux with Firebase. Using Firebase as a backend user authentication, this securely saves all of the user data when logged in. This blog talks about the joy I've had learning the framework, React with Redux. The pain of learning the updated Firebase as I found several youtube videos teaching an old version of Firebase. Some little notes to help me understand the framework and databse better and the process of creating the web app with them.
