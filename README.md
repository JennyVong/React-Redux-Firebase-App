# MarioPlan

This is a Mario styled blog web app that highlights my learning journey of integrating React and Redux with Firebase. Firestore securely saves user data and Firebase is used as a backend user authentication. Cloud Functions are also added to display real time notifications to web application, for whenever someone posts a new blog or a new user has signed up/signed in.
