# React-Redux-Firebase-App

# MarioPlan

This is a Mario styled blog web app that allows users to sign-in/sign-up to create and share their blog articles with other users. I integrated Redux with React in this project to manage the state of the web blog application. Utilitizing Firestore and Firebase as a backend user authentication system, I saved user data and their respective blogs created. Cloud Functions are also added to display real time notifications to web application, so, whenever someone posts a new blog or a new user has signed up/signed in a notification will show up onto the display.
